# Frontend Mentor - Intro component with sign up form

This is a solution to the Intro component with sign up form challenge(https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-component-with-signup-form-5cf91bd49edda32581d28fd1). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

  - Frontend Mentor | Intro component with sign up form
  - The challenge consisted in replicating sign up form for a desktop and mobile view perspective. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page. Receive an error message when the form is submitted any input field is empty or if the email address is not formatted correctly.
  - Here it is two screenshots taken from desktop and mobile perspective;

- My process
  - Built with: HTML + CSS + Javascript
  - This was quite fun to do! At first, I got a little intimidated by the looks and for the programming part of the challenge. However, while doing it, I could actually feel that I am improving myself! The lay-out of the page was very intuitive, as I knew I had to divide the two contents (texts and form) and I did it with flex and grid approaches. I have to say I am liking more and more the grid display, as it is so much easier to change the whole lay-out when reaching the mobile point of view. After setting the lay-out, I was all over the javascript part. This was difficult at first, as I didn't know how to handle the messages. However, I watched a tutorial where, instead of using static tags in the HTML, you could use span and strings as attributes. This was very helpful. Then, I had to select the elements somehow. I am struggling with this selection in Javascript and I will try using JQuery in future projects for this purpose, as it makes the job much easier. To select the span part, I used a div tag as a parent element. I couldn't figure out this at first, but I understood the logic in it after watching another tutorial. Then, the logic part was quite straight forward. I just had to test if every input was set and if the e-mail was written correctly. I got this email pattern and logic from a previous challenge. The overall result, was quite good, I think.
